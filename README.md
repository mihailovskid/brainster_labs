I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, PHP and DataBase for this website

This website contains a main page with all the projects of the academy and a contact form for registering new students. The main page consists of a nav bar with a logo that clicks to the main page, links to other web pages with more information and a contact form for hiring new students. In the Banner section we have a background image with the title of the website, then we have filters, at the beginning there is no active filter and all the cards listed below are shown, clicking on one of the filters allows us to filter the cards by group, this is done with JavaScript, we have 3 types of cards showing completed projects. In the footer section we have only text and background color.

# form

By clicking on hire our student, it takes us to another page where we have a form for information, every field must be filled in for the form to be successfully sent, otherwise invalid feedback will appear, I did it with JavaScript.
#student type
In LocalHost, I created a table with the type of students, which I download with the help of PHP and JavaScript and display in the form in the section where the type of student should be selected.
Once the form is completely filled out, it will transfer you to another page where you will receive a message with a successfully sent application and a table with a display of all previously sent forms.

# database

To save the information from the form and display it in a table I did the following.
in LocalHost I created another table named students and it is connected to PHP to store all the information that comes from the form, then with JavaScript I made a table that will display the data that will come from the created table in the Database. I connected the two tables in the Database, student types and students
and with PHP and JavaSript I made those two tables take information and display on each submitted form.
